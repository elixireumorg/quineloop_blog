      A complex number has the form a + bi where a and b are defined as two real numbers and <math><mrow><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>-1</mn></mrow></math>.<br />
      <br />
      I've always wondered about the reasoning behind this definition of <math><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow></math>
      - why <math><mrow><msup><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>-1</mn></mrow></math>?<br />
      <br />
      I have come to understand that the `+` between `a` and `bi` does not mean that we are somehow going to add `a` into `bi`.<br />
      The `+` is simply a convention - we must look at the complex number as a pair of two numbers `a` and `bi`.<br />
      <br />
      The plot given below is the familiar complex plane. Each point on the plane is a complex number.<br />

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>2.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>2.</span>
      A complex number is a generalization derived from the concept of a number.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <h4>The concept of a number:</h4>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>3.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>3.</span>
      Given a set of things, we use numbers to count and order the things.<br />
      With the use of numbers, we could tell how many things our set contains, call a certain thing the first and some other the last.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>4.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>4.</span>
      Each thing in our set can be represented by a number.<br />
      Given a bag of apples, we can decide that Apple 1 is bigger than Apple 2.<br />
      Being in a bag - real or hypothetical - allows the apples to be counted and arranged relative to other apples in the bag.<br />
      It is not that the apple by itself was countable - the bag had something to do with enabling this ability in our mind.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>5.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>5.</span>
      The number is not the apple, we don't eat the number; the number is an idea that allows us think about things in certain ways.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <h4>The generalization:</h4>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>6.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>6.</span>
      What if there was something, that could be represented (or thought about) better with a pair of numbers.<br />
      And what if, these pairs of numbers had their own rules for addition and multiplication.<br />
      - A pair of numbers with their own " mathematics", slightly differing from the mathematics of our everyday apple counting number.<br />
      If there are such things, we would assume them to be very different from the aforementioned apples.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>7.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>7.</span>
      English language definition:
      <b>Complex</b> - <i>Consisting of many different and connected parts.</i>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <h4>Two numbers, paired to act as one:</h4>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>8.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>8.</span>
      'Complex Number' is the name given to a pair of numbers.<br />
      There are well defined methods for performing math operations on such pairs of numbers;<br />
      - afterall, what good are numbers - complex or otherwise - if there isn't a straightforward way to add them.<br />
      <br />
      But before everything else, one must ask the following questions:<br />
      <br />
      <i>What is it about these two numbers, that we want to pair them and treat the pair as a number?</i><br />
      <i>Do these two numbers in the pair have special abilities?</i><br />
      <i>Are they both alike - in terms of what each of them can do; or, are they very different from each other?</i><br />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <h4>Both alike in abilities, but differing in one fundamental property - their multiplicative identity</h4>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>9.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>9.</span>
      One might ask what the phrase - "abilities of a number" means. Such a question is asking what it means to be a number.<br />
      Simply put, addition & multiplication are two abilities that a number has.<br />
      Multiplication is repeated addition.<br />
      Therefore, one can conclude that the ability to add is what makes the number - if I can add then I can also multiply.<br />
      From the notion of addition we can derive what it means to be greater and smaller when comparing two numbers.<br />
      All of these abilities, as noted previously, allow us to count and order things.<br />
      We could deconstruct and analyze what it means to be a number in more detail, but for now let us move forward without doing so.<br />
      <br />
      The two numbers that are paired to create a complex number are named the <b>Real</b> part and the <b>Imaginary</b> part.<br />
      Real and Imaginary can each be used for counting and ordering the aforementioned apples<br />
      - everything that can be done with a Real number can also be done with an Imaginary number.<br />
      In this sense, they are alike.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>10.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>10.</span>
      While similar, there is one fundamental difference between a Real number and an Imaginary number.<br />
      <br />
      To appreciate the nature of this difference we must first understand the 'multiplicative identity'.<br />
      'Multiplicative Identity' is the name given to a number that when multiplied by does not result in any change.<br />
      Simply put, 1 is the Multiplicative Identity that we are familiar with:<br />
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <mn>5</mn>
          <mo>&times;</mo>
          <mn>1</mn>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>5</mn>
        </mrow>
      </math>
      <br />
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <mn>76</mn>
          <mo>&times;</mo>
          <mn>1</mn>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>76</mn>
        </mrow>
      </math>
      <br />
      <br />
      The Multiplicative Identity for every Real number is 1. Hence, every Real number x, can be written as
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <mn>1</mn>
          <mi>x</mi>
        </mrow>
      </math>
      <br />
      For Imaginary numbers the Multiplicative Identity is defined as <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math>.
      Hence, every Imaginary number x, can be written as
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
          <mi>x</mi>
        </mrow>
      </math>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>11.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>11.</span>
      The question that comes to mind at this point is: why <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math>?<br />
      It is helpful to think about this question by framing the following two questions:<br />
      Why is the Multiplicative Identity the square root of a negative number?<br />
      Why was -1 choosen as that negative number?<br />
      <br />
      We all agree that a negative number cannot have a square root.<br />
      At this point, we should note that before mathematicians arrived at the concept of negative numbers,
      one might have found it impossible to imagine negative numbers.<br />
      Similarly, prior to the evolution of the concept of irrational numbers, it might not have been easy
      to think of numbers that cannot be represented as a fraction of integers.<br />
      The discovery of Zero itself, has been a relatively recent event in the history of mathematics.<br />
      <br />
      In each case, the new discovery was able to represent something that was un-representable in the existing system.<br />
      For example, Rational numbers can express quantities that natural numbers alone cannot - ratios of various nature; ideas that evolved as people started to trade with each other.<br />
      The Greek mathematician Pythagoras initially thought that any number could be expressed as a fraction of two integers.<br />
      Later he learnt that this was not the case and discovered Irrational numbers.<br />
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class='para-brk'></div>

  <h4>The pattern of progress in (mathematical) thought: that which is undefinable will yield the answers we seek:</h4>

  <div class='para'>
    <div class='idx'>12.</div>
    <div class='x'>
      <span class='idx-sm'>12.</span>
      Therefore, if different kinds of numbers were arrived at previously by trying to define that which was undefined<br />
      then it would only be logical that someone would search for a similar pattern and identify the next undefined "thing" to build upon.<br />
      That undefined "thing" was the square root of a negative number.<br />
      <br />
      The choice of <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math> reminds us of 1; it is easy for us to accept 1 as the Multiplicative Identity.<br />
      How different would things be if the Multiplicative Identity of Imaginary numbers was defined as <math><msqrt><mn>-2</mn></msqrt></math>?<br >
      Would we consider <math><msqrt><mn>-2</mn></msqrt></math> to be twice as undefined as <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math>?
      - I don't think we can.<br />
      There can't be degrees of undefinedness when comparing two or more undefined values;<br />
      - If such a case existed we could select one of those value as an 'origin' and define the rest relative to this origin - and they would not be undefined anymore.<br />
      Hence, I think that the choice of -1 is primarly motivated by the need to it make easier for us think of <math><msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt></math> as the Multiplicative Identity.<br />
      <br />
      The symbol i, that is used to represent an imaginary number and which is defined as follows:<br />
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <msup>
            <mi>i</mi>
            <mn>2</mn>
          </msup>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>-1</mn>
        </mrow>
      </math>
      <br />
      <math>
        <mrow>
          <mn>i</mn>
          <mo>=</mo>
          <msqrt><mn>-1</mn></msqrt>
        </mrow>
      </math>
      <br />
      is similar in spirit to the + and - symbols used to denote positive and negative integers.<br />
      It is also similar in spirit to the ... symbol placed after an irrational number like 3.141592653589793...<br />
      <br />
      In all these cases, the symbols allow us to imagine beyond the bounds that were previously established.<br />
      Therefore, the Imaginary number is not some kind of secret, difficult to fathom number.

      Sita Aur Gita is a Indian lost & found movie about two twin sisters; separated at birth; both alike in appearance but exposed to different circumstances.<br />
      Eventually the two sisters meet and Gita introduces herself to Sita thus: <i>"Do not be surprised sister Sita, I am not foreign to you - I am you in a different form".</i><br />
      This is how we can understand the Real and Imaginary numbers - different forms of each other.<br />
      Each unimaginable from the other's point of view, but both exist.<br />
      <br />
      The philosopher mathematician Rene Descartes came up with the term "Imaginary number".<br />
      It seems, his use of the word "Imaginary" was meant to be derogatory.<br />
      However, given all the useful applications it has found, while being part of the complex number, the Imaginary number has done quite well for itself.<br />

      When paired together as a Complex Number, Real and Imaginary numbers form a powerful mental tool.<br />
      This tool allows us work with things & concepts that are best represented & understood by two quantities.<br />
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance">Electrical impedance</a> is an example of such a concept.<br />
      What resistance is in a DC circuit, impedance is in an AC circuit.<br />
      Impedance contains two numbers. Adding and multiplying impedance values is implemented as complex number addition and multiplication.

      Treating a pair of numbers as a single number by defining addition/multiplication etc for these pairs is also done with vectors.<br />
      However vector arithmetic is defined differently from complex number arithmetic.<br />
      Some concepts are better understood with complex numbers, while others are more suitable for vectors.<br />
