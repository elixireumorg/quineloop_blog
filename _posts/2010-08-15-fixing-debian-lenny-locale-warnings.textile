While setting up the Debian lenny server on slicehost for the Quineloop experiments I noticed that after installing the locales package and performing the standard tasks for setting up the locales(section "Set locale" on this <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2009/3/31/debian-lenny-setup-page-2">slicehost page</a>), I was still get the locales warings:

<pre>
can't set the locale; make sure $LC_* and $LANG are correct
</pre>

<pre>
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
        LANGUAGE = (unset),
        LC_ALL = (unset),
        LANG = "en_IN"
    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
</pre>

After some amount of googling I learnt that the standard locales package on lenny is buggy and hence we need to use a couple of alternative packages and reconfigure the locales. Following are the commands that solved the problem from me:

* $ apt-get update
* $ apt-get install belocs-locales-bin belocs-locales-data
* $ nano /etc/locale.gen # Select the locale(s) of your choice)
* $ locale-gen
