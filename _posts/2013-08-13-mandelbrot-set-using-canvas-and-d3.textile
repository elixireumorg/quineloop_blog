      A "Mandelbrot set" is a set that contains as its elements various complex numbers.<br />
      <br />
      To check if <u>a given complex number</u> is in the "Mandelbrot set", we have to <u>perform a certain mathematical operation</u>
      on the complex number <u>over and over</u> to <u>identify if the result has a certain property</u>.<br />
      <h5>Meaning:</h5>
      <u>Given complex number</u>: This refers to any complex number that we can choose at will - to check if it is in the "Mandelbrot set"<br />
      <br />
      <u>The repetitive mathematical operation</u>:<br />
      The mathematical operation <b>squares the given complex number and adds it to itself</b>.<br />
      We repeat this over and over until we can determine if the result will always stay less than some value.<br />
      This property of always staying less then some value is called being <b>"bounded"</b>.<br />
      If the result of a repetative operation is not bounded then it means that it will be -<br />
      Ever increasing - if it moves toward positive Infinity<br />
      or<br />
      Ever decreasing - if it moves toward negative Infinity<br />
      This behavior is called <b>"escaping to Infinity"</b>.<br />
      <br />
      <u>property of the result of this repetitive mathematical operation</u>:<br />
      If, for a given complex number, the result of this repeated operation will remain within some bounds
      than we conclude that the complex number is in the "Mandelbrot set".<br />
      If the result of this repeated operation does not stay within any bounds and keeps moving towards Infinity with each
      repetition - then the complex number is not a member of the "Mandelbrot set".<br />
      <br />
      In the above "Mandelbrot set" visualization, each pixel represents a complex number.<br />
      A pixel is colored black if the complex number it represents is part of "Mandelbrot set".<br />
      If the complex number representing a pixel is not in the "Mandelbrot set" then we assign it a color based on how quickly
      we were able to determine that it will "escape to" Infinity.

  <h4>Who do we implement this as a program?</h4>

      Every complex number in the complex plane is either in the Mandelbrot set or it is not.<br />
      Therefore, to build the Mandelbrot set we have to take each complex number in the complex plane
      and check if it is in the Mandelbrot set.<br />
      <br />
      For example, the following block of code uses two loops, one nested inside the other, to print complex numbers
      between -1 + -1i and 1 + 1i ; in steps of 0.5:<br />

<pre>
for(
  var real_part = -1.0;
      real_part <= 1.0;
      real_part += 0.5
) {
  for(
    var imaginary_part = -1.0;
        imaginary_part <= 1.0;
        imaginary_part += 0.5
  ) {

    var given_complex_number = {
      real: real_part,
      imaginary: imaginary_part
    }
    console.log(
      given_complex_number.real +
      ' + ' +
      given_complex_number.imaginary +
      'i'
    )

    /** This function needs to be implemented **/
    // isMemberOfMandelbrotSet(given_complex_number)

  }
}

OUTPUT:

-1 + -1i
-1 + -0.5i
-1 + 0i
-1 + 0.5i
-1 + 1i
-0.5 + -1i
-0.5 + -0.5i

-0.5 + 0.5i
-0.5 + 1i
0 + -1i
0 + -0.5i

0 + 1i
0.5 + -1i
0.5 + -0.5i

    The mathematical operation contains two complex numbers.<br />
    It performs one complex number Multiplication operation and
    one complex number addition operation.<br />
    <br />
    Let us call the two complex numbers: c and z
    <br />
    The complex number c:<br />
      We have to detect if c is a member of the "Mandelbrot set".<br />
      Therefore, we get to choose the value of c.<br />
    <br />
    The complex number z:<br />
      As we perform the mathematical operation over and over we will store the result in z<br />
      Before we perform the mathematical operation for the first time we will set the value of z to 0.<br />
      Therefore, previous results will have a say in determining the latest result.<br />
    <br />
    step 1: Square z<br />
    step 2: Add c to result of step 1<br />
    step 3: assign the result of step 2 to z<br />
    These 3 steps can be written as:<br />
    z = z^2 + c
    <br />
    We have to perform this operation until we are able to determine if the z is Zero
  </p>

  <h4></h4>
  <p>
    If this result approaches Zero then we conclude that the given complex number is in the "Mandelbrot set".<br />
    Otherwise, we conclude that the given complex number is not in the "Mandelbrot set".<br />
    <br />
    For each complex number that is not part of the Mandelbrot set<br />
    we are interested in knowing how quickly we are able to decide that the<br />
    results of the mathematical operation will not approach Zero.<br />
    <br />
    This property of the result not approaching Zero, is referred to as 'escaping to Infinity'<br />
      - if it is not moving towards Zero, then it must be moving towards Infinity.<br />
    <br />
    How can I be sure that when I perform this operation repeatedly,<br />
    the result will not remain unchanged - neither approach Zero nor escape to Infinity?<br />
    <br />
    to find the answer for these questions, let us look at this mathematical operation:<br />
    <br />
    initialize z = 0<br />
    c = z^2 + c<br />
    
  </p>

  <p>
    z_n+1 = z_n^2 + c<br />
    z_1 = 0^2 + c when n = 0<br />
    z_2 = c^2 + c when n = 1<br />
    z_3 = (c^2+c)^2 + c when n = 2<br />
    z+4 = ((c^2+c)^2+c)^2 + c<br />
  </p>
